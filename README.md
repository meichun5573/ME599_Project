#Abstract
The Cart-Pole Swing-up system is a challenging control problem where the goal is to swing up the pendulum from its initial downward position by controlling the cart's movement. We plan to address this challenge by employing both Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to stabilize the system and achieve the desired control objectives.
